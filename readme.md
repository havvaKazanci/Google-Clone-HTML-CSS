In this project, I created a Google clone using the Scrimba HTML and CSS tutorial. Of course, I made sure to write the code without copying it.

This work helped me understand how objects should be positioned and laid the foundations for CSS.

To download this project:

**Important:** After downloading, make sure to **extract all the files** before opening the website.  

If you open `index.html` directly from the ZIP without extracting, images may not load properly.
After extracting, open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

Thanks for checking out project!
